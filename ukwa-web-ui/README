This is your new Play application
=================================

This file will be packaged with your application, when using `activator dist`.


TODO
----

- W3ACT cache should spot errors and retry.
- It should update collections as it goes along, probably.
- Display Collection tree as a 'nested' list? Flat Bootstrap list but with depth-based indent.
- Use this for thumbs? http://www.webarchive.org.uk/mementos/api/screenshot/http://www.webarchive.org.uk:80/wayback/archive/20120423060016/http://www.bl.uk/

Later

- Thumbnail-from-proxy-mode as part of our Waybacks
- Hook that in for thumbnails and cache well (need a long-lived cache of these specific areas).
- (could also be used in W3ACT)
